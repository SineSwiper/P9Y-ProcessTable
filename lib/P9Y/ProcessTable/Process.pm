=head1 NAME

P9Y::ProcessTable::Process - Base class for a single process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use P9Y::ProcessTable;
 
    my $p = P9Y::ProcessTable->process;
    foreach my $f (P9Y::ProcessTable->fields) {
       my $has_f = 'has_'.$f;
       print $f, ":  ", $p->$f(), "\n" if ( $p->$has_f() );
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This (Moo) classE<sol>object represents a single process.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 fields

Same as the one from L<P9Y::ProcessTable>.

=head2 refresh

This refreshes the data for this process.  Besides construction (via L<P9Y::ProcessTable>), this is the only method that refreshes the data set.
So, don't expect a call to, say, C<<< utime >>> to actually look up the latest value from the OS.

=head2 kill

Sends the signal specified to the process.  For Windows, this is somewhat normalized, so a C<<< $p->kill(9) >>> will terminate the process.

=head2 pgrp E<sol> priority

Unlike the other data methods (below), these two are settable by passing a value.  In most cases, this calls the C<<< set* >>> command from CORE.

=head2 Process data methods

Depending on the OS, the following methods are available.  Also, all methods also have a C<<< has_* >>> predicate, except for C<<< pid >>>.

    pid       Process ID
    uid       UID of process
    gid       GID of process
    euid      Effective UID
    egid      Effective GID
    suid      Saved UID
    sgid      Saved GID
    ppid      Parent PID
    pgrp      Process group
    sess      Session ID
 
    cwd       Current working directory
    exe       Executable (with a full path)
    root      Process's root directory
    cmdline   Full command line
    environ   Environment variables for the process (as a HASHREF)
    fname     Filename (typically without a path)
 
    winpid    (Cygwin only) Windows PID
    winexe    (Cygwin only) Windows Executable path
 
    minflt    Minor page faults
    cminflt   Minor page faults of children
    majflt    Major page faults
    cmajflt   Major page faults of children
    ttlflt    Total page faults (min+maj; sometimes this is the only fault available)
    cttlflt   Total page faults of children
    utime     User mode time
    stime     Kernel/system mode time
    cutime    Child utime
    cstime    Child stime
    time      Total time (u+s; sometimes this is the only time available)
    ctime     Total time of children
    start     Start time of process (in epoch seconds)
 
    priority  Priority / Nice value
    state     State of process (with some level of normalization)
    ttynum    TTY number
    ttydev    TTY device name
    flags     Process flags (not normalized)
    threads   Number of threads/LWPs
    size      Virtual memory size (in bytes)
    rss       Resident/working set size (in bytes)
    wchan     Address of current system call
    cpuid     CPU ID of processor running on
    pctcpu    Percent CPU used
    pctmem    Percent memory used

Make no assumptions about what is available and what is not, not even C<<< ppid >>>.  Instead, use the C<<< has_* >>> methods and plan for alternatives
if that data isn't available.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over

=item *

Certain fields might not be normalized correctly.  Patches welcome!

=back

=over

=item *

Until L<Win32::API> is L<fixed|https://github.com/bulk88/perl5-win32-api>, C<<< kill >>> can't do graceful C<<< WM_CLOSE >>> call to processes on Windows.
